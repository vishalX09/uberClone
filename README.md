# UberClone

This project is meant to be a learning experience. The app is built following along a tutorial by SimCoder. 

Building the app will allow me to:
- Learn more about Android Development 
- Work with Firebase
- Work with other Google APIs
- Arethecutre practice
- And other important Android features

After the app is built, I will focus on improving it. The main focus points on the improvement will be:
- MVVM Architecture
- Convert code to Kotlin
- Better UI
- Testing
